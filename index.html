        <p>
          My field is those of formal systems biology.
          During my Ph.D., I proposed a method to convert a reaction network to a (set of) compatible Boolean automata networks.
          The manuscript is <a href="https://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2023_0135_VAGINAY.pdf">here</a>.
          <!--and the slides <a href="">here</a>. -->
        </p>
        <p>
          What I want is ultimately to
          (1) participate in defining the formal correspondence between those two widely used formalisms,
          (2) propose new alternatives for the analysis of reaction networks
          (3) improve the Boolean networks synthesis methods, when applied on real biological data.
          </br>
          Towards those goals,
          I define my problems in terms of satisfaction of logical constraints,
          I use formal tools such as static analysis and abstract interpretation to define the constraints,
          and SAT solvers and ASP (clingo) for my implementations to beat the curse of complexity.

                Formal models are a central tool to study biological systems.
                In this presentation,
                I will talk about the **synthesis** of formal models,
                from experimental data and knowledge from the literature,
                and the analysis of formal models through their **simulation**.
                I will illustrate those two crucial tasks on two prominent modeling formalisms
                --- reaction networks and Boolean automata networks---,
                which rely on drastically different philosophies :
                the former consists of a detailed description of the underlying biological processes and use continuous time and values,
                and the latter focuses on the influences among the components of the biological system,
                using discrete steps and Boolean values.
                I will also highlight the crucial role of formal methods along the way,
                in particular how logic programming (formal reasoning with answer-set programming in particular)
                can be used to run the synthesis and simulation task rigorously.

                Reaction networks and Boolean networks are two prominent approaches for modeling biological systems.
                They rely on drastically different philosophies: the former consists of a detailed description with continuous time and values,
                and the latter uses discrete steps and Boolean values.
                The automatic conversion of reaction networks to Boolean networks is an important challenge of symbolic systems biology,
                which I address with the SBML2BNET pipeline.
                <br/>
                My presentation delves into the pivotal role of formal methods during the two steps of the conversion process:
                (1) in the definition of the properties of the input reaction network we want to preserve and
                (2) the synthesis of Boolean networks complying with these properties.
                The evaluation of SBML2BNET on synthetic examples and on real-world reaction networks from the repository BioModels
                has demonstrated its effectiveness.
                The perspectives mainly concern the practical relevance of the Boolean networks we synthesize,
                as well as the formal exploration of the relationship with other semantics of reaction networks.

                Reaction networks and Boolean networks are two prominent approaches for modeling biological systems. They rely on drastically different philosophies : the former consists of a detailed process-centred description with continuous time and values and the latter of an abstract species-centred description with discrete steps and Boolean values.
                </br>
                In order to better understand the relationship between these two formalisms, my PhD work focused on converting reaction networks to Boolean networks. This presentation delves into the pivotal role of constraints during the two steps of the process: (1) in the definition of the properties of the input reaction network we want to preserve and (2) the synthesis of the Boolean networks complying with these properties.

              One way to get new insights about complex biological systems is to convert between modelling formalisms. Here, we deal with the conversion of reaction networks interpreted with the differential semantics, into Boolean networks. The conversion is particularly challenging, as it requires a drastic change in perspective: from a process-centred description with continuous time and values to a species-centred description with discrete steps and Boolean values. The conversion I present here is based on my PhD work. It aims at preserving properties from the input reaction network, such as its structure (the direct influences between the components) and its binarised transient dynamics (the transitions between the Boolean configurations). We will see how to extract the structure and dynamics of a reaction network, and how to use answer-set programming synthesise complying Boolean networks. So far, the evaluation of the approach on toy examples and real-world reaction networks from the repository BioModels, has demonstrated it effectiveness in synthesising Boolean networks complying with the input reaction networks. It also paved the way of the formal study of the relationship between the differential semantics of reaction network and Boolean networks. The perspectives mainly concern the practical relevance of the Boolean networks we synthesise, as well as the formal exploration of the relationship with other semantics of reaction networks.

          <h3><a href="https://capsid.loria.fr">caspid</a> "tea-time" seminars</h3>
          Those are monthly scheduled seminars of the capsid team
          During my PhD, the talks below have mostly been used to keep my team updated about my work,
          and to rehearse presentations for conferences and other seminars.
          This is why I keep the list separated from the other talks.
